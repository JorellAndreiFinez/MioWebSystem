                Through the years, the Rotary Club of Makati has provided assistance in various forms to the school, notably an audiovisual room outfitted with specialized audio equipment for which the Club applied for a $12,000 matching grant during the term of PP Ricardo “Ric” Librea. The Club has also donated two hybrid air-conditioning units that run on solar power and LED lights that have cut the school’s monthly electricity bill by 50%.

            <p>
                The Rotary Club of Makati has been helping the Philippine Institute for the Deaf (PID) for 21 years with the help of past chairman Cesar Campos. His is a two-sided advocacy—one, for the students whose auditory capabilities are severely impaired; and two, for the method used by the school to usher them from the realm of silence to the realm of sound-- the sound of their own voice used in speech.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Rotary Club’s assistance efforts for the school began in 1994 during the term of Rotary Pres. Carlos del Rosario with annual donations to its scholarship fund. Its last donation, of P350,000, was in July 2015 at the beginning of its golden anniversary year.
            </p>
            <p>
            From time to time, students and faculty are invited to a Rotary Club meeting, during which previously-mute children get to show off their newly-acquired oral language skills. The Rotarians in turn pay occasional visits to the school. The Club also supports the annual culminating activity at year end, where the children perform in a musical program that showcases lessons learned and skills acquired during the year.
