                <p>
                The ISP Day School Program offers classes for children ages 12-30 years.  Its year-round school provides academic classes for the Junior High (Grades 8-11) and Senior High (Grade 12) on a full-time basis five days per week, from 7:20am-3:30pm.  We follow the prescribed DepEd Curriculum for Secondary Education, with particular focus on speech and communication skills. ISP is an inclusion school which sits regular “hearing” high school students with the ORALLY trained deaf students.  They learn together and help each other achieve their academic goals and eventually be partner-friends in mainstream society.

                <p>
                    PID Parent-Professional- Infant Program called “Sound Beginnings” is an early intervention program designed for families with infants or children (1 - 3 years) who have been newly diagnosed as having a hearing loss.
                    <br><br>A Master Teacher/School Head conducts quarterly center-based sessions with families. Parents and family members learn through demonstrations, hands-on participation, and printed materials how they can create a language-rich environment in their home in an attempt to promote better listening and speech communication skills in their children. Families are taught how to turn everyday activities into language building activities, which leads to improved social interactions within the family. Through Sound Beginnings these young children are provided with the educational foundation preparing them for the more formal classroom environment when enrolled in the PID preschool program.

                <h3>Audiological Services</h3>
                <p>
                    The School Clinician, trained at the Manila Hearing Aid Center by Board Member Dr. Jose F. Abano, ENT/Audiologist, listed a number of Hearing Evaluation Procedures as a requirement for admission of students.  The Otoscope Exam helps to assess the condition of the external auditory canal (EAC), tympanic membrane (TM), and the middle ear. Mastering the Otoscope Exam leads to accurate diagnoses, allowing for targeted treatment and prevention of complications. 
                    Pure-Tone Testing, with the use of an Audiometer, we put earphones on a patient/student, and request to raise hand whenever hearing the “beep”.  It is also called Air Conduction Testing since the sounds go through one’s outer and middle ear.  This test helps find the quietest sound one can hear at different pitches, or frequencies.  Having earphones on, lets the sound go to one ear at a time.  Testing Young Children – Young children sometimes do better if they play games.  
                    We sometimes use also the Visual Reinforcement Audiometry (VRA) – where we teach the child to look to where the sound came from.  When the child/student looks in the direction of the sound, they see a moving toy or flashing light.  This rewards the child for looking out for the sound.  Both ears are tested at the same time;  and the Conditioned Play Audiometry  (CPA) – for toddlers and pre-schoolers, ages 2-5, the child will do something each time he hears a sound.  He may put a block in a box, put pegs in a hole, or put a ring in a cone.  This type of testing is good.
                    Most of our students are required to do these Pre-Admission Tests, in addition to submitting the child’s previous Audio- logical Assessment.  The School’s Assessment is compared with the results of the student’s previous report, and thereon, subjected to annual checks.  We partner with Hearing Aid Centers where we refer students for further evaluation and fitting of hearing aids.  Should a case necessitates an ENT consultation/treatment, two members of the School Board
                    are ENTs – Dr. Gil M. Vicente of St Luke’s Hospital and Dr. Norberto V. Martinez of UST Hospital.

            Every year, thousands of children are born with, or acquire, some degree of hearing impairment.        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, 95 percent of these children have at least some degree of residual (or undamaged) hearing. Only about 5 percent have what can be termed as a "total loss" of hearing, for whom the cochlear implant is now available. As a general rule, it can be said that if a hearing-impaired child does not develop the ABILITY TO SPEAK, it is because he was simply not taught to do so. Since the 1860s, Alexander Graham Bell and other scientists concerned with the auditory process have known that any degree of natural hearing can be utilized as an aid to speech development.        </p>

            The Sergia Esguerra Memorial Foundation, Inc. [SEMFI], with its two special schools – Philippine Institute for the Deaf [PID] and Integrated School of the Philippines [ISP]  utilizes "ORAL" instructional methods for the purpose of developing speech and language skills for deaf children and youth.  NO SIGN LANGUAGE IS USED. The common goals for every young student at the school are to LISTEN, LEARN, AND TALK.   PID program is the pioneer and premier ORAL School for the deaf in the Philippines since 1988 and "one of a kind" in the Asia Pacific Region.  ISP is a model “Inclusion” High School, where orally trained elementary deaf graduates sit with “hearing” peers taught by specially trained SPED Teachers where they receive regular classroom instruction consistently found in most schools.   Although Japan Oral School was first in Asia, its medium of Instruction is in the Japanese Language.  SEMFI believes that the use of English as a medium of instruction will help the graduates to be more globally competitive and adept in a chosen career.  The primary emphasis for the children is on developing listening and spoken language skills. Once listening skills are developed a child can begin to develop speech and language skills that will allow them to communicate in the mainstream.</p>

Once listening skills are developed a child can begin to develop speech and language skills that will allow them to communicate in the mainstream. Some people believe that deaf children can do everything BUT hear, but with proper amplification (hearing aids or cochlear implants)  SEMFI and those committed to the auditory/oral approach believe that deaf children can do everything AND hear! This is particularly true today with the advent of cochlear implants. Helen Keller was once quoted as saying: "Why should we be content to crawl when we can soar like an eagle?" It has been clearly proven over the last few decades that with early identification, appropriate and aggressive audiological intervention, and immediate training by skilled professionals, even the most profoundly deaf children can develop and effectively use hearing to learn speech and language. The objective of this specialized training is to utilize what hearing a child may have to assist in the development of speech ... enabling the deaf child to become a part of, rather than apart from, A WORLD OF SOUND.</p>
