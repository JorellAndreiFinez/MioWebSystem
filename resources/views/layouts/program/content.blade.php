        <h2>Welcome to PID, Where Learning Begins!</h2>
        <p>
            The Philippine Institute for the Deaf (PID) exists for the purpose of ensuring that these unique resources are readily available to those young children who need them. With the combined support of the community, young deaf children in the Philippines continue to have the opportunity to listen, learn, and talk.
